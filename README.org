These are my GNU/Linux configuration files. [[https://github.com/SqrtMinusOne/dotfiles][View at GitHub]].

I use the [[https://leanpub.com/lit-config/read][literate configuration]] strategy via Emacs' [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] wherever possible. It has its pros and cons, but I find it pretty nice to keep the configs interweaved with comments in a handful of files.

The files themselves are managed and deployed via [[https://yadm.io/][yadm]], although I use Org Mode for things like config templating.

My current GNU/Linux distribution is [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]]. I like Guix because, among other things, it allows [[https://guix.gnu.org/cookbook/en/html_node/Advanced-package-management.html#Advanced-package-management][to declare the required software]] in configuration files, so I can have the same set of programs across multiple machines (look for tables with "Guix dependency" in the header).

The central program to all of that is, of course, [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]. At the time of this writing, it takes ~50% of my screen time and has the largest share of configuration here.

(/Apparently, links on the second level work only in Emacs 🙁/)

A few other repositories I may consider a part of my config:
- [[https://github.com/SqrtMinusOne/channel-q][channel-q]] is my Guix channel
- [[https://github.com/SqrtMinusOne/sqrt-data][sqrt-data]] is a home for my statistics gathering effort
- [[https://sqrtminusone.xyz/emacs-packages/][My Emacs Packages]], some of which originated in my Emacs config
